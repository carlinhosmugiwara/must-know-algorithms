The logic is pretty straight forward

We're gonna pass through every index of a given array to see if the element is present there, if it is the
index will be printed, if not a message saying it's not present will be printed.

The time complexity is O(n)

Linear search is a brute force algorithm, so it is not efficient for large arrays
